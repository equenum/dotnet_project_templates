# dotnet_project_templates

My custom .Net project templates.

## MightyConsole.Template

A simple .Net Console App template with support for Dependency Injection, application settings, and everything else that comes with `IHostBuilder` (`Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`).

## [MightyMentorConsole.Template](MightyMentorConsole.Template/content/MightyMentorConsole.Template)

A simple .Net Console App template tailored for better workshops, live coding sessions, and knowledge-sharing experiences. Can be useful to mentors/trainers for showcasing not only basic C# syntax and features but also more advanced concepts, like Dependency Injection, application settings, asynchronous and parallel execution, and so on. Offers a set of useful built-in utilities, making working with the console easier and more visually precise. The utilities and project structure are kept simple so that they are easy to understand for beginner developers.
